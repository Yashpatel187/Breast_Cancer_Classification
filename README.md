# Project Overview
This project focuses on the binary classification of breast tumors as either Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous). Early detection is vital in reducing mortality rates, and machine learning provides a reliable second opinion for medical professionals.

# Dataset
We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
Features: Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more.
Target: M (Malignant) or B (Benign).

# Technologies Used
Language: Python.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
Models Explored: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest.
